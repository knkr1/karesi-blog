Hi, I’m Kaan (also known as Karesi), a hobbyist with a strong passion for programming.

I’ve worked with C++, Java, Lua, JavaScript, Rust, Python, and more.

I also have experience with Linux servers—hosted my own website (Nginx) and mail server.

Currently learning CAD (OnShape), Machine Learning (PyTorch), and 3D Graphics (OpenGL).

I made this blog to share my journey and help others. Feel free to reach out!
