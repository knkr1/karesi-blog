# Introduction

Welcome to my personal blog! This is my first post and I would like to talk about me, why I opened this website, what I'll post and maybe more.

### Myself 👋

Hello, my name is Kaan and I'm from Turkiye. 

To shortly introduce myself, I've been passionate about programming since my childhood. I like to do new projects and learning new skills.

At the moment, I'm learning CAD and more complex topics (Low Level Programming, OpenGL, Machine Learning, etc.) or at least trying 😁

### About This Blog

This blog's goal is to teach people about things from my perspective. As a consequence of not being a native english speaker, I had various problems while learning programming by myself.
I think learning something is possible for everybody with the correct setting for the individuals .
My goal is to explain and review what I know at the same time.

### What Kind of Posts I Plan

I'll post many topics such as STEM, personal life, and maybe more.

### What do you mean by Pilot Episode?

From Wikipedia:

> A television pilot (also known as a pilot or a pilot episode and sometimes marketed as a tele-movie) in United Kingdom and United States television, is a standalone episode of a television series that is used to sell a show to a television network or other distributor. A pilot is created to be a testing ground to gauge whether a series will be successful. It is, therefore, a test episode for the intended television series, an early step in the series development, much like pilot studies serve as precursors to the start of larger activity.

### Last Thoughts

I hope that this blog will help as many people as possible. See you later.
