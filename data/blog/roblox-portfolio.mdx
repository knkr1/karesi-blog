summary: My personal portfolio for Roblox Development

# Introduction

Hello, to keep it short, I'm a Roblox developer who's been into programming since 2019.  
Even though my passion for development goes way back, my professional experience started in 2024.

# Tools/Skills

  Luau - It's the heart of Roblox programming. With **Luau**, I'm familiar with concepts like **OOP,
  Module Loaders, Frameworks**, etc. Still learning more every day.

  Rojo - My go-to choice for programming. It makes the workflow way more comfy for me.

  roblox-ts - Still learning it, but it's really fun to use for making games. Tons of libraries and
  tools that open new doors for devs.

  react-lua - I've been learning react-lua and tools like
  [charm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/charm), and motion libraries.
</span>

- Server & Client Safety - I'm paranoid when it comes to client-server communication. You wonâ€™t have to worry about exploits through remote events.

- Bug Fixing - Been hired for bug fixing several times.

> [!NOTE]  
> I've only used **react-lua** with **roblox-ts** because of the JSX support, but I think I could adapt to Luau easily too.

# Skills Outside of Roblox Development

Even though I focus on Roblox, I also have some other skills that could help in certain situations.

  Server Tools (Especially AWS, EC2) - Been into Linux servers for a while, especially AWS because
  of the free EC2 plans. Iâ€™ve hosted websites with nginx, APIs, and Minecraft servers. I also had
  some experience with Linode.

  C++ - I work (sometimes) with C++, especially for 3D graphics [(OpenGL)](https://www.opengl.org/).
  Not sure how useful it is for Roblox, but it helps me understand some low-level stuff in game
  graphics.

# Past Projects

Tbh, I havenâ€™t collected many projects, so this is just the tip of the iceberg.

[Blexjack](https://github.com/knkr1/blexjack) - An open-source blackjack framework built with OOP. It has anti-cheat and can handle cases like players leaving mid-game, etc.

[The Despair](https://www.roblox.com/games/6513331433/The-Despair-V0-4-WIP) - A really old game (2023) where I learned like 70% of what I know about GUIs. Not a full game, kinda messy code, but a big learning project for me.

[Untitled Jail Game (Discontinued)](https://www.roblox.com/games/91503277957056/Untitled-Game) - A prison game attempt. It had stuff like data saving, player ranking, key card system, etc.

# Payment / Terms Of Service

Since I'm mainly looking for experience, prices are pretty chill. But Iâ€™ll consider the difficulty too.

- Minimum is $8 for my time
- Prices depend on time/effort

## Payment

- ðŸ˜€ **Pay Per Task** (Preferred)
- ðŸ˜€ **Milestone Payments**
- ðŸ™‚ **Partial Up-Front**
- ðŸ˜¡ **Percentage** (Unless the game has actual players, then maybe)

## Payment Types

- ðŸ˜€ **Paypal**
- ðŸ˜€ **Crypto**

- ðŸ˜¡ **CashApp** (Donâ€™t have it)
